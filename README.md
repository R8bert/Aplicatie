1. LOGIN & Main Page user manual

The introduction to the instruction manual provides a brief overview of the functionality of the application's login page. It highlights the importance of proper authentication and describes the process by which users can enter their username and password to access the app's functionality. It also mentions that in case of a successful login, the user will be redirected to the main page or the corresponding functionality, while in case of a failed login, the user will receive an error message and will be required to review and re-enter the correct information.
 
The main page of the UniCatalog application provides quick buttons for accessing various important modules and functionalities. Users can manage study cycles, study programs, study years, curricula and associated subjects, information about students, groups, teachers, users and catalogues/grades. These buttons facilitate quick and easy navigation in the application, allowing users to effectively manage various aspects of academic management and student assessment.

2. Education cycles
A faculty can offer study programs for several levels of training or way of conducting the didactic process. For example, faculties usually offer bachelor's and master's degree programs. These are called learning cycles; the application must allow defining them.

2. Teaching staff

The "Teachers" module in the UniCatalog application allows the management and association of teachers with the subjects they teach, offering add, edit and delete functionalities. Users can enter information such as name, surname, employee brand, title and position for each teacher, thus ensuring an accurate and up-to-date record. This module facilitates the efficient administration of teacher data, contributing to the proper organization and management of information within the UniCatalog application.
3. Study programs
The study programs (specializations) are subordinate to the education cycles and represent the training paths that students can follow within the faculty.
